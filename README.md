Welcome Developers. These files are the source of the Marauderscape server. Included is just about every file we need to edit to make changes to the game, as well as a compiler
and the actual server(run.bat). Best way to learn how to make changes is to use the existing code as a reference or to look up tutorials!We will obviously be communicating as we code,
but be sure to add to the changelog that I add so we all know what the heck we did. 

HELP: Add your questions or problems here and someone can try to answer or fix for you.
- I also am having trouble adding defence requirement to rune armor. All help appreciated. -Colin
- Incredibly frustrated by doors. I'm giving up on them and teleporting for now. -Colin
